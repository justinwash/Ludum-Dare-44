## Ideas by theme
<sup>Incorporate Darwin into the game no matter what the theme.</sup>

#### Limited Memory
* The player character is reliving/remembering an experience. The level is short at first, but each time you beat it you remember more, so more of the level gets added to the end. Start from the beginning each time. As memories become clearer perhaps the past parts of the level change as well?

#### Ridiculously Overpowered
* A "bomb-defusal"-esque game where you do certain actions (flip switches, unplug and replug wires, press buttons, etc) to raise and lower the power level of an electricity-powered machine. There's a guage that goes from "Ridiculously Underpowered" to "Ridiculously Overpowered" and if it reaches either of those you lose. Could either be "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" style puzzle game or "Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime" style platforming.

#### Your Life is Currency
* There is not only one Death, but a town populated by Deaths who use human souls as currency. Play as one of these Deaths, traveling to the mortal world to perform undertakings in order to afford to furnish your cute little bungalow in the 'burbs of Deathville.

#### Side Effects
* Control a Cube that spins up to 90 degrees at a time. It has 4 different colored sides that have different effects on the things it contacts. Obstacles fly in from the four sides of the screen that should be dealt with with the specific effects of the sides of the cube. E.g. bounce circles away with the blue side and explode triangles with the yellow side but absorb squares with the red side for health and collect stars with the green side to get points.

#### Space Exploration
* This boring af theme better not be picked.
* Cats in space that shoot later beams. ðŸ™€
* Lazer*
* Get Out Of My Space! See how far you can encroach your belongings on your dorm-mates side of the room before they notice and throw you out.
* Space doge Darwin searches the universe for his lost mom. Working title: Aubrey Left The House Again

#### Change the Genre of a Classic Video Game (pls no)
* Tetris + Pinball. Use pinball flippers to smack tetriminos into place at the top of the screen.
* Call it Pintrist.

#### Only One Enemy
* One long boss fight? Could maybe do a SHMUP/bullet-hell thing with a single enemy that changes its patterns at set intervals?

#### Risky Powerups
* Cocaine?

#### Shelter
* A hiking game where you try not to get eaten by bears? ????
* Zombears
* Reverse Ski-Free
* Hard mode: QWOP style different buttons per leg. Push them out of order and you trip and get eaten.

#### Color Changes Everything
* Puzzle platformer where collecting different colored pickups changes the current season. E.g. the blue pickup makes it winter so the river freezes over and you can cross.
* It'd be cool if you could do it in a way where it happens really often instead of different phases of the game? Like you have to avoid accidentally making it winter again because insert disadvantage?
* Or maybe press a button to change the background color to make platforms of specific colors appear . E.g. jump off a red platform, change the background to red so that one dissappears and the green one you're jumping to shows up.

#### Everything has a Price
* See "Your Life is Currency".

#### Contagious
* Low-effort anti-vaxxer game. *shrug*

#### Tiny Town
* See "Your Life is Currency".

#### Mutation
* See "Risky Powerups".

#### No Upgrades, Only Downgrades
* On trial for a crime you definitely, totally committed, lie your best to convince the judge to lessen your charges. It's not gonna get better, but it could definitely be worse.

#### Underground
* Paperboy style game where you hand out flyers for your band's basement show in the hip part of town. Get points for each flyer given, but make sure you only give them to the COOL peaople. There's some definitely uncool people in this crowd that might get you shut down if they find out.
