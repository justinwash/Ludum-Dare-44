# Ludum-Dare-44
A game made for Ludum Dare 44

## Ideas by theme

#### Limited Memory
* The player character is reliving/remembering an experience. The level is short at first, but each time you beat it you remember more, so more of the level gets added to the end. Start from the beginning each time. As memories become clearer perhaps the past parts of the level change as well?

#### Ridiculously Overpowered
* A "bomb-defusal"-esque game where you do certain actions (flip switches, unplug and replug wires, press buttons, etc) to raise and lower the power level of an electricity-powered machine. There's a guage that goes from "Ridiculously Underpowered" to "Ridiculously Overpowered" and if it reaches either of those you lose. Could either be "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" style puzzle game or "Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime" style platforming.
